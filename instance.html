    <p> An instance variable is a variable that is specific to a certain object. It is declared within the curly braces of the class but outside of any method. The value of an instance variable can be changed by any method in the class, but it is not accessible from outside the class. Instance variables are usually initialised when the object is created. This is done with an instance initializer block, a special block of code run when an object is created.Instance variables can have initializers, a block of code executed when an instance of the class is created. Class variables cannot have initializers. </p>
